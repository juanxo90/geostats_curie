Replication and visualization for the results obtain in the paper Geostatistical mapping of the depth to the bottom of magnetic sources and heat flow estimations in Mexico (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650521001826).

This repo will take teh results of the depth to the bottom of magnetic source from the paper and replicate the geostatistics using python insted of GSLIB.
