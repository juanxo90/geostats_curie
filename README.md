# Geostatistical mapping of the depth to the bottom of magnetic sources from Mexico

This repo will take the results of the depth to the bottom of magnetic source from the paper and replicate the geostatistics using python insted of GSLIB. The notebooks used will shows basics statistics, normal score tranformation, variogram calculation, variogram modelling and sequential gaussian simulations. I pretend to used google colab but if is not possible to used it, the branch will run in a MSI laptop model GL-8SC under windows subsystem for linux (WSL) with 11 gb of ram, windows 11 and 6 physcal cores (I not totally sure if I can running it using the GPU).

The aeromagnetic data used and the Depth to the bottom of magnetic source calculations are available at: **J.L. Carrillo-de la Cruz, R.M. Prol-Ledesma, G. Gabriel.
